1. we declared all the methods and main todos array in context because if i woudnt have declared it then imagine deleteTodo is present in my TodoItem component and we deleted it but how would my main todos array would know that an item has been deleted , so we would have to use setTodos... so basically we need to pass todos state and setTodos , which is basicallyy nothing but prop drilling , if i add more features then it will cause more prop drilling
